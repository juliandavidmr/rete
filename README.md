Introduction
----
**Rete** is a modular framework for visual programming. **Rete** allows you to create node-based editor directly in the browser. You can define nodes and workers that allow users to create instructions for processing data in your editor without a single line of code.

This project is a bifurcation of ReteJS, with some differences:
- Completely written in Typescript.
- More detailed definitions and interfaces.

Features under development:
- Decorators for the creation of components, controls, events, etc. e.g: `@Component`, `@Control`, `@Event`...
- Automatic documentation of functions, classes and constants.
